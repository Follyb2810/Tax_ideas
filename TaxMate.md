# ⭐ **TAXMATE NG — Full Breakdown (What, Why, How)**

---

# ✅ **1. WHAT is TaxMate NG?**

TaxMate NG is a **personal tax assistant app** for Nigerians who earn money outside a traditional salary — especially freelancers, creators, remote workers, and side hustlers.

Think of it like:
**“PiggyVest + QuickBooks + a personal tax lawyer… but for Nigerian freelancers.”**

It:

* Calculates how much tax you should pay
* Helps you file it easily
* Tracks your income from different platforms
* Protects you during NRS “lifestyle audits”
* Sends reminders so you never get fined

It removes the stress of figuring out Nigerian taxes.

---

# ✅ **2. WHY TaxMate NG is Needed**

### **Because the 2026 tax reforms completely changed the rules.**

Starting January 2026:

* If you earn **more than ₦800,000/year**, you **must** file tax.
* Remote workers, creators, influencers, and crypto traders are now **legally required** to report their income.
* Failure to file can lead to:

  * **₦50k–₦500k fines**
  * Bank account audits
  * “Presumptive tax” based on your lifestyle (spending vs income)

Most freelancers:

* Don’t understand the tax brackets
* Don’t know what to file
* Don’t know where to file
* Don’t know how to calculate correctly
* Don’t know that VAT applies to many services

This fear + confusion = MASSIVE demand for a simple tool.

### **Why this will explode**

* Millions of Nigerians now earn online
* Government is digitizing everything (NIN + BVN + TIN connected)
* Banks will start reporting high inflows
* Freelancers must prove that their income is legitimate and taxed

**TaxMate NG gives people peace of mind.**

# ✅ **3. HOW TaxMate NG works**

Here’s the simple workflow:

---

## **A. User creates account**

They enter:

* Name
* NIN or BVN
* Type of work (e.g., Upwork, TikTok, crypto, Bolt, etc.)

---

## **B. App connects income sources (optional)**

User can connect:

* Bank alerts (via Mono/Okra API)
* Upwork / Fiverr exported earnings
* PayPal screenshots
* YouTube or TikTok dashboard earnings
* Crypto P2P receipts

You don’t need full access — only income totals.

---

## **C. App calculates taxes automatically**

The app uses the 2026 tax rules to compute:

* PIT (personal income tax)
* VAT (if applicable)
* Any exemptions
* Allowable expenses

Users immediately see:

* “How much tax you owe this month”
* “How much VAT you need to remit”
* “Your estimated annual tax”

---

## **D. App sends reminders**

* Quarterly PIT deadlines
* Monthly VAT deadlines
* Bank inflow alerts (“You’ve crossed ₦800k for the year — you now must file”)

---

## **E. App generates documents**

* Tax payment slips
* Revenue receipts
* Income statements
* Proof for audits
* Annual tax report for your records

This is what freelancers need when NRS checks their account.

---

## **F. App helps with audit protection**

If NRS flags their bank account, the user can press:
**“Generate Audit Defense Pack”**
→ The app compiles all earnings + taxes paid in a clean PDF.

---

# 🎯 Summary: WHAT, WHY, HOW in 30 seconds

### **WHAT:**

A simple mobile app that calculates and files tax for freelancers automatically.

### **WHY:**

Because from 2026, anyone earning over ₦800k must file taxes or face heavy fines — and freelancers have *no idea* how to comply.

### **HOW:**

By connecting income sources, computing taxes using updated rules, reminding the user, generating filing documents, and providing audit support.
