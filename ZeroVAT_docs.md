Sure! Let’s break down **ZeroVAT** using **WHAT → WHY → HOW** in the simplest, most practical way.

# 🟦 **ZeroVAT — WHAT, WHY, HOW (Simple Breakdown)**

## ✅ **WHAT is ZeroVAT?**

A **simple e-invoicing + VAT tracking app** for Nigerian businesses that will be required to issue NRS-approved electronic invoices starting 2026.

Think of it like:

**“1-tap government-approved receipts + automatic VAT tracking.”**

It replaces handwritten receipts, Excel sheets, and WhatsApp price lists.

**Core things it does:**

- Creates official **NRS-compliant e-invoices**
- Auto-calculates VAT for every sale
- Tracks VAT paid on purchases (input VAT)
- Shows VAT the business needs to remit or reclaim
- Stores all invoices in the cloud
- Lets auditors or customers verify invoice authenticity

---

## 🟨 **WHY ZeroVAT will blow up in 2026?**

### **1. Government mandate**

From 2026, many SMEs (₦50m–₦500m turnover) must use **only electronic invoices**.
Handwritten receipts will lead to:

- Fines of ₦1m+
- Business shutdowns
- Delays during audits

This means **every shop, supermarket, POS agent, pharmacy, boutique, small restaurant, etc.** will _urgently_ look for an easy tool.

---

### **2. SMEs don’t know what “e-invoicing” means**

Most don’t understand:

- How to generate it
- What system to use
- How to track VAT

A simple app that handles everything = instant adoption.

---

### **3. Existing solutions are too complex**

Current ERP systems are:

- expensive
- too complicated
- built for large companies

ZeroVAT is **made for small businesses**, not corporations.

---

### **4. Easy recurring revenue model**

Once a business starts issuing invoices with your app, they **never stop**.
Reliable long-term money.

---

## 🟩 **HOW ZeroVAT works (the execution model)**

### **1. User registers business**

They enter:

- Business name
- TIN
- Address
- Type of products/services

The app automatically configures VAT rules (standard, zero-rated, exempt).

---

### **2. They create invoices in one tap**

Business owner selects:

- Customer name (optional)
- What they sold
- Price

App automatically:

- Adds VAT (7.5%)
- Generates NRS-compliant invoice
- Gives a QR code + invoice link
- Saves it to the cloud

---

### **3. VAT dashboard auto-updates**

Every invoice updates:

- **Output VAT** (VAT from sales)
- **Input VAT** (VAT from purchases)
- **Net VAT payable** (Output – Input)

This becomes the **monthly VAT report** they need to file.

---

### **4. Monthly reminders**

App reminds them:

- VAT filing deadlines
- How much they owe
- If they are eligible for reclaim (input VAT > output VAT)

---

### **5. Business insights**

Simple charts showing:

- Top-selling products
- Total sales
- VAT trends
- Customer history
