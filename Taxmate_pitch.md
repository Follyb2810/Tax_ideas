# 🎤 **Presentation Script — TaxMate NG**

**Slide 1 — Title**
_Good day everyone. Today, I’m excited to introduce **TaxMate NG**, the personal tax assistant built specifically for Nigerian freelancers, creators, and remote workers._

---

**Slide 2 — Problem**
_From January 2026, Nigeria’s new tax reforms require anyone earning above **₦800,000 per year** to file taxes.
This includes freelancers, YouTubers, TikTok creators, crypto traders, designers, developers, Bolt drivers — basically everyone making money outside a traditional salary._

_The challenge is simple:_

- _Most people don’t know how to calculate their tax._
- _They don’t know when to file._
- _They don’t know what NRS checks using BVN, NIN, and bank inflows._
- _And they are afraid of the new fines and lifestyle audits._

_This confusion is affecting millions of Nigerians._

---

**Slide 3 — Solution**
_TaxMate NG solves this._

_It is a personal tax assistant that automatically calculates your taxes, reminds you of deadlines, prepares your payment slips, and protects you during NRS audits._

_In short, it makes tax filing simple, fast, and stress-free._

---

**Slide 4 — What TaxMate NG Does**
_Here’s how it works:_

1. _You create an account and enter your basic details._
2. _You connect or enter your income sources — Upwork, bank inflows, crypto trades, YouTube revenue, anything you earn._
3. _TaxMate NG instantly calculates how much tax you owe based on the 2026 rules._
4. _It sends monthly and quarterly reminders._
5. _It generates all the documents and receipts you need to stay compliant._
6. _And if NRS flags your account, the app creates an “Audit Defense Pack” that proves your earnings and taxes._

---

**Slide 5 — Why It Matters**
_For the first time in Nigeria, freelancers and remote workers are legally required to file taxes.
Most of them have never done this before.
They need a simple tool that tells them exactly what to pay, when to pay, and how to pay — without fear._

_TaxMate NG answers that need perfectly._

---

**Slide 6 — Why Now**
_2026 is the year Nigeria goes fully digital with tax enforcement.
TIN, NIN, and BVN are being connected.
Banks will report large inflows.
Freelancers must show proof of income and proof of taxes._

_The timing for TaxMate NG couldn’t be better.
The demand is already massive — and growing daily._

---

**Slide 7 — Business Model**
_TaxMate NG runs on a freemium model:_

- _Free for users earning less than ₦5 million per year_
- _Premium plans from ₦2,500 to ₦15,000 per month for higher earners_
- _Plus revenue from integrations with payment platforms_

_It’s affordable for users, and sustainable for long-term growth._

---

**Slide 8 — Closing**
_In a country where millions are entering the digital economy, TaxMate NG will become the everyday tool that keeps freelancers compliant, confident, and protected._

_Thank you._
