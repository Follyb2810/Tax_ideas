### My personal ranking for a solo/indie developer in Nigeria right now (easiest → highest revenue potential):

1. **TaxMate NG** (#1) → fastest to build, huge demand already on X/Facebook groups, clear virality among freelancers.
2. **TaxGuru Chatbot** (#5) → cheapest to launch (just WhatsApp Business API), builds trust and email list for life.
3. **ZeroVAT** (#2) → slightly harder but you can charge the most per customer.
4. **TIN-on-the-Go** (#4) → agent model scales crazy fast once you have 50–100 agents.
5. **SME TaxShield** (#3) → biggest revenue per customer but longer sales cycle.

Which of these five excites you the most? Let’s pick one and I’ll give you the exact MVP feature list + tech stack + go-to-market plan for launch before March 2026.
