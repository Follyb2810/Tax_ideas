Great question — and this is very important for how TaxMate NG works.

Here’s a clear, simple breakdown of how we can be sure a user’s earnings are correct without invading privacy or accessing anything unsafe.

✅ How TaxMate NG Confirms a User’s Real Earnings

There are four safe, legal, non-intrusive methods to verify income. Users can choose any of them — no forced access.

1. User Uploads Income Proof Manually (Most Common)

The user uploads:

Upwork earning statements

Fiverr monthly summaries

YouTube/AdSense dashboard screenshots

PayPal/Payoneer PDF statements

Crypto P2P receipts

Bolt/Uber weekly earnings

TaxMate NG extracts only totals, not sensitive details.

Why this works:
These platforms generate official downloadable reports.
Users trust this method because they control what they upload.

2. Bank Transaction Import (Optional)

Using secure fintech APIs (like Mono, Okra, Stitch), the user can allow the app to read credit transaction totals only, not full details.

We do not see:

balances

PINs

passwords

full statements

We only see inflows labeled as earnings, such as:

“Upwork”

“Fiverr”

“Payoneer”

“AdSense”

“Client transfer”

TaxMate NG uses them to estimate monthly income automatically.

Why this works:
This matches what NRS will check when doing lifestyle or bank audits, so it keeps the user protected.

3. Direct Platform Integration (Where Possible)

For platforms that support API connections (e.g., Upwork or PayStack invoices), the user can connect their account.

The app retrieves:

earnings totals

date

currency

No access to messages, clients, or private data.

4. Smart AI Estimation (When User Has No Records)

For hustlers who don’t track income well (e.g., barbers, POS agents, artisans), the app can estimate income using:

Average monthly inflow

Their business type

Price per service

Volume of customers

Their spending patterns (optional)

This gives a realistic taxable estimate to avoid penalties.

🎯 Final Safety Check: User Always Confirms the Total

After gathering all this information, the app shows the user:

“Your total estimated monthly income is ₦xxx,xxx.
Is this correct?”

User can:

accept

adjust

add more

remove wrong items

So the user is always in control.

🔐 Why This System Works

It mirrors what NRS will see during an audit

It’s user-controlled

It avoids privacy risks

It allows flexibility depending on the user’s earning style

It works for both tech freelancers and offline hustlers

If you want, I can also write:
📌 A technical explanation for developers
📌 A business explanation for investors
📌 A marketing explanation for users (simple language)

Just tell me which version you want next.

Great question — and super important for building TaxMate NG correctly and legally.

Here’s the safe, legal, and practical way to ensure the user’s earnings are accurate without invading privacy or breaking rules.

We focus on verification, not spying.

✅ How TaxMate NG Confirms a User’s Earnings Are Correct

We use four layers of verification, all optional, all user-controlled, all legal.

1️⃣ Bank Transaction Summary (Most Reliable Method)

Users can connect only their credit inflow totals through a secure API (like Mono/Okra).

Important:

You DO NOT access full statements.

You DO NOT see sender names.

You DO NOT see balances.

You only see monthly totals like “₦420,000 inflow in March”.

This allows the app to say:

“Your inflows this month are ₦420,000. We will calculate tax based on that.”

This matches how NRS will check earnings in 2026 (they also use inflow totals).

2️⃣ Platform Income Upload

For creators and freelancers, users can upload or type in income from platforms like:

Upwork earnings PDF

Fiverr weekly summaries

YouTube Studio earnings

TikTok Creator Fund

PayPal/Payoneer summaries

Bolt/Uber weekly revenue

Binance P2P receipts

TaxMate NG extracts the total amount.

This helps people who keep work money separate from personal bank accounts.

3️⃣ Manual Entry (For simple users)

For traders, artisans, market sellers, and small hustlers:

They can type:

“I earn around ₦50k per week”

“I make ₦300k per month selling graphics”

The app then calculates everything based on their declared income.

But we still encourage:

“Connect bank inflows for more accuracy.”

4️⃣ Auto Red Flags (Consistency Checks)

The app quietly checks for impossible combinations:

Examples:

User claims ₦500k income, but bank inflow shows ₦3 million.

User says they’re below ₦800k yearly, but inflow is already ₦1.2m.

The app will notify them privately:

“Your bank inflows look higher than what you entered.
Do you want us to update your income for correct tax calculation?”

This protects them from NRS “lifestyle audits.”

No reporting. No sharing. Just advice.

🎯 BONUS: Proof of Earnings for NRS

All this data allows the app to generate:

Income Summary Report

Annual Financial Statement

Audit Defense Pack

So if NRS flags the user’s bank account, they can show clean records.

✅ Summary — How We Ensure Correct Income
Method Accuracy User Privacy Notes
Bank inflow totals ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very high Best option
Platform uploads ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High Great for creators
Manual entry ⭐⭐⭐ Medium Good for hustlers
Auto red-flag checks ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ High Protects user

No spying. No tracking.
